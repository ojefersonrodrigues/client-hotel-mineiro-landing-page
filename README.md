# Hotel Mineiro Landing Page
A simple yet high-converting landing page for **Hotel Mineiro**, a local hotel in Aparecida do Norte â€” a famous religious city in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

## About the Project
This project was built for a former client who owns a hotel in Aparecida. The goal was to showcase the accommodations and convert visitors into paying customers, especially from search traffic generated by Google Ads.

Despite the minimalistic structure, the page proved to be highly effective in turning paid traffic into bookings, thanks to a clear presentation of services, trust elements, and direct call-to-actions.

## Design Choices
- Focused on trust-building with guest reviews and real photos
- Highlighted value proposition clearly (why visit, whatâ€™s included, how to book)
- Minimal distractions â€” only one main call to action
- Clean layout for fast mobile navigation
- Strategic use of images to illustrate proximity to religious landmarks

## Technologies Used
- WordPress
- Elementor Page Builder
- Hello Elementor Theme
